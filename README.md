A developers goodie for [Strapi Headless CMS](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) which provides a basic core set of types &amp; interfaces and generic utilities useful for every plugin creator or team which is extending the core implementation.

## ‚ú® What's included?

- **Strapi Core:** Basic set of types &amp; interfaces which include `Strapi`, `DB`, `ContentType` and more.
- **Generic utility types:** Useful for plugin creators and teams which are extending Strapi.

## ‚è≥ Installation

(Use **yarn** to install this dependency within your Strapi project (recommended). [Install yarn with these docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).)

```bash
yarn add -D strapi-typed@latest
```

After install typings should be automatically available if you import from `@strapi/strapi`.

If you want to use are internal utility types then use

```typescript
import { StringMap, OnlyStrings } from "@strapi/typed";
```

In few place plugin creator or Strapi consumer can extend couple of interfaces to add custom typings

For example

```typescript
declare module '@strapi/strapi' {
  export interface IStrapiRequestQueryFiltersExtra {
    threadOf?: number | string | null;
  }
}
```

Enjoy üéâ
